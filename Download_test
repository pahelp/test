Microsoft ActiveX' controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that help certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such signatures help ensure that unmodified software is downloaded and that you can identify active signers to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software. The Allow software to run or install even if the signature is invalid setting allows you to manage whether downloaded software can be installed or run by users even though the signature is invalid. An invalid signature might indicate that someone has tampered with the file. If you enable this policy setting, users will be prompted to install or run files with an invalid signature. If you disable this policy setting, users cannot run or install files with an invalid signature. Note Some legitimate software and controls may have an invalid signature and still be OK. You should carefully test such software in isolation before you allow it to be used on your organization's network. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.
Rationale:
Microsoft ActiveX controls and file downloads often have digital signatures attached that certify the file's integrity and the identity of the signer (creator) of the software. Such signatures help ensure that unmodified software is downloaded and that you can positively identify the signer to determine whether you trust them enough to run their software. The validity of unsigned code cannot be ascertained.
