.0 Purpose
To maintain security over the environment this standard sets requirements for system account management and specifies authorization levels for system access.
2.0 Scope
This standard applies to all information systems in PRA.
3.0 Policy Statement
System account management and the appropriate use of administration privileges is required to maintain security.
3.1 Policy Details
Use if the DUA (daily use account) is prohibited for administrative or elevated access to the PRA systems. 
IT infrastructure personnel are required to use a separate AAA (administrative access account) for administrative access to systems.  Naming convention for AAA accounts is: DUA2 where DUA is the daily use account login name.
Non IT infrastructure personnel are required to use a separate EAA (elevated access account) for access to servers.  These accounts must be attained and used in accordance with the Elevated Account Provisioning and Access Process. The role EAAs play in security is one of isolation from the IT collaborative resources used to support the business like email and community purposed information stores. These resources may carry yet undetected malware potentially infecting key business or customer systems. Naming convention for EAA accounts is:  DUA_adm where DUA is the daily use account login name.
Built in administrator accounts should only be used when there is no other alternative available. 
3.1.1 Windows
•	Access for Windows systems is provided at three levels: Active Directory, Domain and Server Local. Active Directory administrative access shall be provided via the PRANT_1 Domain, which is trusted by all client domains. 
o	Active Directory access will be granted via a PRANT_1 account and effective levels of permissions via PRANT_1 group associations. 
o	Domain access will be granted via an account created locally to the domain and effective levels of permissions provided via group association within than domain. 
o	Server Local access will be granted via an account created locally on the server and effective levels of permissions provided via group association on that server. 

•	Enterprise Domain Administrative authorization will be applied to all Windows administrators through a PRANT_1 association. 
•	IT infrastructure personnel in direct support of the environment will also maintain Domain Level accounts in each specific environment being supported. 
•	Windows System account management will be maintained on an environment basis with both Domain and Local account management. 
•	Deviations from this standard shall be approved in accordance with the Elevated Account Provisioning and Access Process.
